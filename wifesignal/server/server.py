"""
WifeSignal server - bridges the iPhone app (HTTP) to the ESP32-C3 lamp (BLE).

    [iPhone app] --HTTP/Bearer--> [this server] --BLE--> [ESP32-C3 lamp+button]

The app speaks 3 colors (green/yellow/red) + acknowledged; the device speaks a
single state byte: 0=all off, 1=red, 2=yellow, 3=green (one lamp at a time).
An active un-acknowledged signal lights its lamp; clear or acknowledge turns
all lamps off. A physical press of any button while a lamp is on acknowledges
the signal (app shows "Seen", color is kept until cleared).

Endpoints (all JSON, Bearer auth except /health):
    POST /v1/signal  {"color": "green"|"yellow"|"red"}
    POST /v1/clear
    POST /v1/ack
    GET  /v1/status
    GET  /health     (unauthenticated, for launchd/ops health checks)

Response keys are camelCase (sentAt, acknowledgedAt) - the iOS app decodes
with a bare JSONDecoder, so snake_case would silently drop the timestamps.

Matches the board by SERVICE UUID, never by name: macOS hides advertised
names (they come back None), but the service UUID is in the advertisement.
