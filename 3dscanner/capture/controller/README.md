# Scan Session Controller (`shika`)

Drives a full turntable photogrammetry session: capture a frame, rotate the
turntable by N°, settle, capture the next, download + verify every JPEG
immediately, then validate and package the set for reconstruction.

Python, standard library plus PyYAML and pyserial. ~1,900 lines and 25 tests.

## Setup

From the project root:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && ./.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
cp config/scanner.example.yaml config/scanner.yaml   # then edit device details
export SCANNERCAM_TOKEN=...   # from the ScannerCam Settings screen
```

`scan.py` re-execs itself under `.venv` automatically, so `./capture/controller/scan.py …`
works without activating the venv.

## Turntable assumptions

The remote is **pre-armed** by the operator before a session: continuous mode,
clockwise, at a fixed speed. The controller only sends the `START_PAUSE` IR
toggle (start → stop). Because a toggle is not an absolute command, an
interrupted/ambiguous move leaves the state `unknown` and requires manual
intervention — the controller never auto-toggles out of it.

Angles are **nominal** (time-based, uncalibrated). Photogrammetry recovers true
pose from image features, so nominal angles are fine; add
`calibration/turntable/default.yaml` (spec §17) to override run times per step.

## Commands

```bash
./capture/controller/scan.py test-camera                       # probe ScannerCam
./capture/controller/scan.py test-turntable                    # send one start + one stop toggle
./capture/controller/scan.py preflight --name red_mug --degrees 10
./capture/controller/scan.py run       --name red_mug --degrees 10 --settle-seconds 2
./capture/controller/scan.py run       --name manual --degrees 10 --turntable noop
./capture/controller/scan.py resume    scans/incoming/<session_id>
./capture/controller/scan.py package   scans/incoming/<session_id>
./capture/controller/scan.py cleanup   <project_id>
```

`--yes` skips confirmations for unattended runs. Exit codes follow spec §29
(0 success, 3 preflight, 4 camera, 5 turntable, 6 verification, 8 resumable,
9 turntable state unknown).

## Layout

```
scan.py                 CLI entry point
controller/             config, models, errors, state, session loop, packaging
camera/scannercam.py    ScannerCam HTTP client (stdlib urllib)
turntable/              base interface + noop + arduino_ir (wraps firmware/turntable_ir)
tests/                  pytest suite (run: ./.venv/bin/python -m pytest capture/controller/tests)
```

The Arduino driver wraps `firmware/turntable_ir/turntable.py` (the source of
truth for IR codes); no IR codes are duplicated in this package.

## Integrity and recovery

Every JSON artifact is written temp-file → `fsync` → `os.replace`, so `state.json`
is never observed half-written. Downloads land as `frame_NNNNNN.jpg.part` and are
renamed into position only after verification — an interrupted transfer cannot
masquerade as a good frame, and a leftover `.part` file is a hard validation failure.

`resume` re-validates every JPEG on disk rather than trusting the recorded state,
then requires the operator to confirm manual realignment before continuing, because
the physical rotation angle never survives an interrupted session.

Retries are idempotent: `request_id` is `uuid5(session_id, frame)`, so a retry is
byte-identical and the phone returns the original capture rather than firing again.
On an *ambiguous* capture failure the controller issues a `HEAD` for the remote frame
before re-firing — the photo may already have landed.

## Tests

```bash
./.venv/bin/python -m pytest capture/controller/tests
```

25 tests, no mocking library — dependencies are injected through constructor seams
and substituted with hand-written fakes. `test_scannercam.py` runs a real
`http.server` on a random port and exercises the client over actual TCP.
`test_turntable.py` pins the safety machine in both failure directions: a failed
*start* toggle and a failed *stop* toggle must each leave the state `unknown`.

Two of the tests exist because of bugs found on the physical rig — a pagination loop
that re-fetched page one forever, and transport exceptions that are not `URLError`
subclasses and were escaping unwrapped.

## Known gaps

- **No log file.** `scan_log` is in the session layout and nothing writes it; all
  operator feedback is `print()`.
- **`camera.fallback_url` is parsed and never used**, despite existing to solve a
  documented hostname-resolution problem.
- **`session.failed_root` is never written to** — a failed session stays in
  `incoming/`.
- **The controller lock has a TOCTOU race**: an `exists()` check followed by a write,
  where `O_CREAT|O_EXCL` was called for.
- **`reconstruction.json` hardcodes the camera device string**, which is now wrong.
- `resume` re-captures every frame after the first gap rather than only the missing
  ones. Correct, because the server dedupes, but wasteful.
